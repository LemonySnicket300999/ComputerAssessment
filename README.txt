Hello ma'am,
Good Day.

This is my Computer Assignment for the internal assessment.
I made the site on my favourite subject i.e. Science and
focused on the science of astronomy and astrophysics.
Because they are my favourite subjects to study.
I even want to beome an astrophysicist when I grow up.

This site was prepared for the Internal Assessment of Computer 
for my class, X-B. This site was coded with HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
and with the implication of Bootstrap.
I actually had my JS and Bootsratp code ready with me, from my
previous projects. So I quickly coded some CSS and SCSS files
and an Index HTML file.

This project was completed under 48 Hours, 
excluding the time required by me previously to code the JS and Bootstrap files.

This project is also available as a repository on my GitHub page https://github.com/LemonySnicket300999
(The link is also available on the Site)

I hope you liked my Site.

Thank You for reviewing it.

Yours Sincerely
Aditya Chaudhary
